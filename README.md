# samlex
A library for making making an Elixir app act as a SAML Service Provider

## Inspiration
I am using the [esaml](https://github.com/arekinath/esaml) library as inspiration for this library.  

## TODO
- I'm still deciding if I just use esaml as a dependency and create Elixir wrappers or to rebuild it entirely in Elixir.
- Once this is finished, write a strategy for plugging into [ueberauth](https://github.com/ueberauth/ueberauth)
